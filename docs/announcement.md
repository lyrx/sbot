Hey everyone, I built a Solidity code analyzer the other day and thought I share it here with you!
Feedback and contributions are most welcome.

🚀 Introducing SBOT Codalyzer: THE Solidity Code Analyzer! 🚀

🔍 Looking to ensure your Solidity code is secure? SBOT is here to help! This Python-based static
analyzer identifies common patterns that might hint at potential security vulnerabilities in your Solidity code.

🌟 Features:

🚫 Detects outdated Solidity compiler versions.
⚠️ Identifies the use of pragma experimental.
💰 Checks for potential unlocked ether.
📞 Warns about low-level .call() usage.
🛡️ Highlights potential misuse of tx.origin vs. msg.sender.
🕵️‍♂️ Verifies function visibility specifiers.
🔧 Easy Setup & Usage:

Clone the repo.
Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
Analyze a single file or an entire directory with a simple command!
🔗 Want to extend the analyzer? It's designed for easy extensibility. Add more checks by creating new functions
and integrating them into the main script.

🤝 Join Us! We're actively seeking contributors to enhance the analyzer and add more checks.
If you're passionate about blockchain security and Solidity, submit a pull request
and be a part of our growing community!

⚠️ Disclaimer: While SBOT provides valuable insights, it's not a replacement
for manual code reviews or dynamic analysis. Always consult with experts when deploying smart contracts.
