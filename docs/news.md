## September 22, 2023 📣 Exciting Updates! 🚀

I've been hard at work refining our `SBOT CODALYZER` Solidity analysis tools. Here's a quick rundown of the latest changes:

1️⃣ Moved the check_structures to a dedicated module named bloodhounds.py for better modularity.

2️⃣ Enhanced the code to dynamically accept the key (like "initial") and paths directly from the command line, making it more flexible and user-friendly.

3️⃣ Introduced a shell script to seamlessly run our Python analyzer, ensuring a smoother user experience.

Big thanks to the OpenAI assistant for guiding us through these improvements! Stay tuned for more updates. 🛠️✨
