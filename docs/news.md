Hi guys, here is my proposition what to do and discuss together with Yama, 
but at the same time ensure that this goes in line with Marco and his targets.

1. Engage a bit more with SBOT Analyzer as already discussed

2. Set up "mydex" together and enhance it a bit like this:

a. Extract the smart contracts and hardhat to a seperate project.

b. Use a testnet instead of the local hardhat node, then deploy it to the web

c Develop some sort of distributed authentication mechanism to this, using
a Merkle proof for ethereum addresses. So the array of authorized addresses
should be hel off chain, where a smart contract does the authorization 
check, storing only a Merkle root.


What do you think? Wuld that be a way to go for me and Yama?

### üì£ Exciting Updates! üöÄ

I've been hard at work refining our `SBOT CODALYZER` Solidity analysis tools. Here's a quick rundown of the latest changes:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Moved the check_structures to a dedicated module named bloodhounds.py for better modularity.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced the code to dynamically accept the key (like "initial") and paths directly from the command line, making it more flexible and user-friendly.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Introduced a shell script to seamlessly run our Python analyzer, ensuring a smoother user experience.

Big thanks to the OpenAI assistant for guiding us through these improvements! Stay tuned for more updates. üõ†Ô∏è‚ú®
